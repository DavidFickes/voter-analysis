# voter-analysis
A collection of routines to analyze voter registrations records focusing on profile and GOTV.
Unfortunately, the firm that sponsored this work has asked that the code remain non-public for the near future as they do not wish to have their sources and methods public. I have reached an understanding with them that this embargo will be lifted on December 1, 2016 -- see you then.
